### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I would like to introduce myself,so my name is Roger Witkowski and I am a Junior Fullstack Developer in C# and .NET. 

I started my journey with programming in Codecool in 2021 :) During this year i became Junior Fullstack .NET Developer.
These experiences showed me the path of self-development and the discipline i want to follow, to be an even better version of myself from yesterday.
I am still developing myself, i am hungry for knowledge and open for new challenges and help others :) 
 

 
I am `Junior Fullstack .NET Developer`ðŸ’».

I will be happy to help you, of course if you let me know aboutðŸ™‚

Feel free to contact me in any caseðŸ™‚.
